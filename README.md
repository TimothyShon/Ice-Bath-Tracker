This web based application allows users to track their ice baths everytime they take one. Users can create their own account so they can keep individual data seperate from others. 
They can enter details of their ice bath such as temperature, duration, and time. 
Clicking on the "Log" button will bring you to a log of all your logged ice baths where users are able to delete any entries if they so wish.
Clicking on the "statistics" button will bring you to a page with statistics about your ice baths, such as average duration and total time spent.
